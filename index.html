                    <p class="lead">A consensus is forming: robotics + physical AI is the next great frontier. Where do I position myself here as a founder?</p>
                </div>

                <p class="lead">Everyday billions of critical actions—performed by surgeons, farmers, forklift drivers—fade away without leaving behind accessible, structured data. Meanwhile, software industries thrive because of their endless digital footprints.</p>

                <p>Whatever data exists is already hoarded by the incumbents who built the machines. John Deere can figure out every seed planted; Intuitive Surgical knows every tremor of a scalpel. In a way, they're the only eyes in the room.</p>

                <p>Software is no exception here; Proxycurl built a $10 million ARR business on scraped LinkedIn data until lawsuits forced their closure. Shaky foundations are turning into proprietary lock-ins.</p>

                <p>Owning the data pipeline is more powerful than owning the best model. Once a vendor controls the raw footage, lock-in precedes intelligence and lock-in is permanent.</p>

                <h3>My Solution for Founders</h3>

                <p class="section-lead">You are not competing with the OEM.</p>

                <p>Instead of challenging incumbents head-on, provide immediate autonomy benefits through retrofit hardware. I would pitch a simple proposition:</p>

                <blockquote class="strategy-quote">
                    "Let us bolt this kit onto your fleet. You get instant autonomy features tomorrow; we both get more data."
                </blockquote>

                <p>Collaborating with nimble, intelligent teams is a powerful bet for institutions weighed down by bureaucracy and lack of intelligent talent.</p>

                <h4>Take Control of the Data Pipeline</h4>

                <p>Barrier-to-entry for hardware is at the lowest it's ever been. While you won't be building forklifts & assembly lines, you'll build add-on devices that capture even more data.</p>

                <p>Productive value-adds can capture the same valuable data with a fraction of the overhead. Imagine a self-driving kit fitted onto a forklift that collects data on warehouses, performance, and use-cases.</p>

                <p>Once the flywheel spins—data → fine-tuned models → better autonomy → more users → more data.</p>

                <div class="article-conclusion">
                    <p><strong>If you want to matter in the next decade, stop writing code that begs for data. Start bolting small boxes onto big machines and quietly sip the data stream.</strong></p>

                <h2>my definitive AI workflow</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="writeup-content">
                <h3>After over 2 years of AI development experimentation I've found my flow and transformed my role</h3>
                <p>I began like many others: testing local LLMs and cycling through the latest coding assistants. Nothing endured. </p> 
                <p>Early workflows were inefficient as they involved dragging files, copying outputs, pasting changes. MCP integrations promised structure but never worked.</p>
                <p>The debate around coding with LLMs is polarized. Executives imagine full automation; skeptics dismiss the field outright. The truth is between these extremes. </p> 
                <p>For backend engineers like me, LLMs cut the friction of learning frameworks, trying multiple designs in parallel, and asking questions without hesitation.</p>
                <p>The chat format quickly became a limitation. Tracking revisions and branches was impossible. Terminal-based tools like Claude Code helped, but remained costly and opaque.</p>
                <p>Atlassian’s Rovo Agent changed that. With its beta release I could split sessions across repositories, generate prototypes, and review code properly inside VSCode.</p>
                <h4>I came up with a cool workflow:</h4>
                <h4>Step 0: Figure out what you want to build</h5>
                <p>Can't help you with that one. Whatever it is, you should have a long brainstorming session where you write everything down before reviewing.</p>
                <h4>Step 1: Fight with the LM</h5>
                <p>Refine your brainstorm doc to get the gist of what you want then feed it into the LLM.</p>

                <blockquote class="strategy-quote">"Attached is the BRAINSTORM.md for Timeio, an automated timecard OCR processor. Go through the document and challenge decisions & assumptions made. Questions should be asked one by one and discussed at length before proceeding. Use the answers from the discussions to inform a new PRD in PRD.md."</blockquote>
                
                <p>The results are stunning. It's not just the magic of the PRD itself but the process by which you're actually digesting your own thoughts and second-guessing prior assumptions. By the end of the discussion (usually about an hour) the biggest transformation is in your own  mental model of your now-refined plan.</p>
                <h4>Step 2: The Sprint Plan</h5>
                <p>We know what we're building now. Organize everything by generating a Sprint Plan. Atlassian's Rovo Agent has native Jira integration so I use that (free Claude credits under the hood).</p>
                <p>Review the sprint plan once generated. Don't sweat the details much here because the PRD should cover the main requirements; this is for tackling tasks in an organized manner and making it easier for you to review the code piece-by-piece later.</p>
                <h4>Step 3: The Execution Sprint</h5>
                <p><strong>Plan, vision, and sprint in hand. We're ready to go.</strong></p>
                <p>You've put in hours of work & now it's time to reap the rewards. The strong mental vision of the finished product, coupled with the documented detail will now come to fruition.</p>
                <p>The sprint plan is now the central tracking mechanism for the coding agent(s).</p>
                <h4>Step 4: Back at The Wheel</h5>
                <p>Armed with all the context, you now <em>review</em> code. Yes you actually need to read it almost line-by-line and ask questions. I have a custom keybinding that drops a <code>REVIEW:</code> comment based on the filetype. After commenting my feedback there, I go back to Rovo and it addresses my concerns or challenges my thinking.</p>
                <h4>Closing out</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mistakes I see: Treating LLMs as magic typewriters. Skipping design, planning, and documentation. Failing to integrate with task management or write tests. The real bottleneck is now system-level thinking, not typing speed.</li>
                    <li>My role shifted upward. I spend my time on design, architecture, and database schemas.</li>
                    <li>If AI coding feels shallow, start with planning. Write requirements by hand before using a model. Only then introduce an agent into the loop. Use tools that support review, write proper tests, and keep documentation alive. AI does not remove the work it just accelerates it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>teaching data structures & algos to hundreds of students made it clear what's missing</h3>
                <p><em>this writeup was inspired by my dear friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/khader-murtaja/" target="_blank">Khader - somebody who's always pushing me to grow</a></em></p>

                <h4>"it can't be me; it's the market"</h4>
                <p>I won't gaslight you. The job market for software professionals in the US is undeniably down, but it's not the market's job to fix your life.</p>
                <iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=1LPdz&width=670&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>
                <blockquote class="strategy-quote">live data, so maybe it'll be up by the time you see this?</blockquote>
                <p>Software "engineering" is far too broad a term. It includes everyone from embedded C driver wizards to a guy who built a website a year ago.</p>
                <p>There is no degree, comittee, or professional exam to check if you know <strong>how software is built.</strong></p>

                <h4>Enter: System Design</h4>
                <p>A core feature of software development is the <em>architecting of software systems</em>. Coding agents reduce the marginal cost of each LoC, making elegant architecture all the more important for capturing the benefits of AI.</p>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Land_Information_System_Architecture.gif" alt="Land Information System Architecture" style="max-width:100%;margin:24px 0;" />
                <p>I won't bore you. If you have no idea what system design is you should check out <a href="https://hellointerview.com" target="_blank">hellointerview.com</a>. It's a great starting point for understanding what Redis vs Cassandra vs S3 vs . . . is all about.</p>
                <p>System Design is best learned in production. My years working on AWS S3 definitely helped, but it's tough to land those opporutnities without understanding the basics.</p>
                <p>At this stage <strong>focus on understanding, not completing</strong>. The goal of system design interviews is to break down the depth of your knowledge. We're looking for those who have the knowledge but can also use it creatively & come up with novel insights on the fly.</p>

                <h4>Data Structures & Algorithms</h4>
                <p>I've taught hundreds of students the gambit of data structures & algorithms.</p>
                <p>The truth of this stage is, <strong>you need to do the reps</strong>.</p>
                <p>The students I had that didn't excell were largely not putting in the work. Resources-wise, this is the most saturated space in all of software education content.</p>
                <p>leetcode remains a gold standard for problem sets and new entrants have sprung up to deal with the understanding of DS&A. I hear <a href="https://neetcode.io" target="_blank">neetcode.io</a> is really good.</p>
                <p>If you're in a hurry - go through the <a href="https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=blind75" target="_blank">Blind75</a>. It's meant to be as exhaustive as possible for the fewest questions required.</p>
                <p>When I was practicing DS&A years ago, I dedicated my days just to problems. If you put in the work, you will develop a "second sense" for which solution is appropriate to the problems.</p>
                <p>Don't focus on memorizing the problem, just focus on understanding <strong>why</strong> the optimal solution was optimal. If you do this reliably and with enough volume - you win.</p>

                <h4>Closing out</h4>
                <p>People lament software interviews for "not resembling the job". In reality, the 2 basic topics above are great for morphing your brain for the thinking required in backend systems development. System design in particular will make you a much more aware developer. I would consider it the closest thing we have to actual "engineering".</p>
                <blockquote class="strategy-quote">Before you start, put together a strict calendar and treat System Design like a college course - learning and evaluating constantly. DS&A is a craft - set aside lots of training windows and you'll fly through problems before you know it. Focus a week on DS&A literature at most before diving head first into problems. Don't overthink that part.</blockquote>

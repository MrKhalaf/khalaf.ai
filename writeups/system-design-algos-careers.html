                <h4>"it can't be me; it's the market"</h4>
                <p>I won't gaslight you. The job market for software professionals in the US is undeniably down, but it's not the market's job to fix your life.</p>

                <blockquote class="strategy-quote">live data, so maybe it'll be up by the time you see this?</blockquote>
                <p>Software "engineering" is far too broad a term. It includes everyone from embedded C driver wizards to a guy who built a website a year ago.</p>
                <p>There is no degree, comittee, or professional exam to check if you know <strong>how software is built.</strong></p>

                <h4>Enter: System Design</h4>
                <p>A core feature of software development is the <em>architecting of software systems</em>. Coding agents reduce the marginal cost of each LoC, making elegant architecture all the more important for capturing the benefits of AI.</p>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Land_Information_System_Architecture.gif" alt="Land Information System Architecture" class="article-img" />
                <p>I won't bore you. If you have no idea what system design is you should check out <a href="https://hellointerview.com" target="_blank">hellointerview.com</a>. It's a great starting point for understanding what Redis vs Cassandra vs S3 vs . . . is all about.</p>
                <p>System Design is best learned in production. My years working on AWS S3 definitely helped, but it's tough to land those opporutnities without understanding the basics.</p>
                <p>At this stage <strong>focus on understanding, not completing</strong>. The goal of system design interviews is to break down the depth of your knowledge. We're looking for those who have the knowledge but can also use it creatively & come up with novel insights on the fly.</p>

                <h4>Data Structures & Algorithms</h4>
                <p>I've taught hundreds of students the gambit of data structures & algorithms.</p>
                <p>The truth of this stage is, <strong>you need to do the reps</strong>.</p>
                <p>The students I had that didn't excell were largely not putting in the work. Resources-wise, this is the most saturated space in all of software education content.</p>
                <p>leetcode remains a gold standard for problem sets and new entrants have sprung up to deal with the understanding of DS&A. I hear <a href="https://neetcode.io" target="_blank">neetcode.io</a> is really good.</p>
                <p>If you're in a hurry - go through the <a href="https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=blind75" target="_blank">Blind75</a>. It's meant to be as exhaustive as possible for the fewest questions required.</p>
                <p>When I was practicing DS&A years ago, I dedicated my days just to problems. If you put in the work, you will develop a "second sense" for which solution is appropriate to the problems.</p>
                <p>Don't focus on memorizing the problem, just focus on understanding <strong>why</strong> the optimal solution was optimal. If you do this reliably and with enough volume - you win.</p>

                <h4>Closing out</h4>
                <p>People lament software interviews for "not resembling the job". In reality, the 2 basic topics above are great for morphing your brain for the thinking required in backend systems development. System design in particular will make you a much more aware developer. I would consider it the closest thing we have to actual "engineering".</p>
                <blockquote class="strategy-quote">Before you start, put together a strict calendar and treat System Design like a college course - learning and evaluating constantly. DS&A is a craft - set aside lots of training windows and you'll fly through problems before you know it. Focus a week on DS&A literature at most before diving head first into problems. Don't overthink that part.</blockquote>

                <h3>After over 2 years of AI development experimentation I've found my flow and transformed my role</h3>
                <p>I began like many others: testing local LLMs and cycling through the latest coding assistants. Nothing endured. </p>
                <p>Early workflows were inefficient as they involved dragging files, copying outputs, pasting changes. MCP integrations promised structure but never worked.</p>
                <p>The debate around coding with LLMs is polarized. Executives imagine full automation; skeptics dismiss the field outright. The truth is between these extremes. </p>
                <p>For backend engineers like me, LLMs cut the friction of learning frameworks, trying multiple designs in parallel, and asking questions without hesitation.</p>
                <p>The chat format quickly became a limitation. Tracking revisions and branches was impossible. Terminal-based tools like Claude Code helped, but remained costly and opaque.</p>
                <p>Atlassian's Rovo Agent changed that. With its beta release I could split sessions across repositories, generate prototypes, and review code properly inside VSCode.</p>
                <h4>I came up with a cool workflow:</h4>
                <h4>Step 0: Figure out what you want to build</h4>
                <p>Can't help you with that one. Whatever it is, you should have a long brainstorming session where you write everything down before reviewing.</p>
                <h4>Step 1: Fight with the LM</h4>
                <p>Refine your brainstorm doc to get the gist of what you want then feed it into the LLM.</p>

                <blockquote class="strategy-quote">"Attached is the BRAINSTORM.md for Timeio, an automated timecard OCR processor. Go through the document and challenge decisions & assumptions made. Questions should be asked one by one and discussed at length before proceeding. Use the answers from the discussions to inform a new PRD in PRD.md."</blockquote>

                <p>The results are stunning. It's not just the magic of the PRD itself but the process by which you're actually digesting your own thoughts and second-guessing prior assumptions. By the end of the discussion (usually about an hour) the biggest transformation is in your own  mental model of your now-refined plan.</p>
                <h4>Step 2: The Sprint Plan</h4>
                <p>We know what we're building now. Organize everything by generating a Sprint Plan. Atlassian's Rovo Agent has native Jira integration so I use that (free Claude credits under the hood).</p>
                <p>Review the sprint plan once generated. Don't sweat the details much here because the PRD should cover the main requirements; this is for tackling tasks in an organized manner and making it easier for you to review the code piece-by-piece later.</p>
                <h4>Step 3: The Execution Sprint</h4>
                <p><strong>Plan, vision, and sprint in hand. We're ready to go.</strong></p>
                <p>You've put in hours of work & now it's time to reap the rewards. The strong mental vision of the finished product, coupled with the documented detail will now come to fruition.</p>
                <p>The sprint plan is now the central tracking mechanism for the coding agent(s).</p>
                <h4>Step 4: Back at The Wheel</h4>
                <p>Armed with all the context, you now <em>review</em> code. Yes you actually need to read it almost line-by-line and ask questions. I have a custom keybinding that drops a <code>REVIEW:</code> comment based on the filetype. After commenting my feedback there, I go back to Rovo and it addresses my concerns or challenges my thinking.</p>
                <h4>Closing out</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mistakes I see: Treating LLMs as magic typewriters. Skipping design, planning, and documentation. Failing to integrate with task management or write tests. The real bottleneck is now system-level thinking, not typing speed.</li>
                    <li>My role shifted upward. I spend my time on design, architecture, and database schemas.</li>
                    <li>If AI coding feels shallow, start with planning. Write requirements by hand before using a model. Only then introduce an agent into the loop. Use tools that support review, write proper tests, and keep documentation alive. AI does not remove the work it just accelerates it.</li>
                </ul>

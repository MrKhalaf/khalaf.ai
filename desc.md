Task: Generate a very basic, slick website that looks like largely plaintext with a header
- Avoid any fancy detail, the font should look sharp and old computer style
- Should contian a header with khalaf.ai with writeups and projects.
- projects tab should allow for thumbnails and a project desc
- writeups should be blogs (remove date for now)
- mid-dark grey background (#b8c8c6), black text is cool.
